    <p>Hi, <%= firstName %>,</p>

    <p>
      I hope all is well. I know it's been almost <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months
      since last we talked, but I thought you might be interested to hear what I am up to. Currently, I'm learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy and having a blast.

      If you are interested in staying abreast of all that I am learning, I'll be writing about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog.

       Check out my most recent posts:

        <ul>
      <% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
         <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].href %>> <%= latestPosts[i].title %></a>  </li>
      <% } %>
    </ul>

      P.S. This is an auto-generated email I learned how to make at Fullstack! Pretty cool, right?

      Best,<br>
